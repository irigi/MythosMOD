MythosMOD
=========

CK2 mod Mythos (by Mayaka), my own customization


--------------------------------

Installation: Put the Mythos folder and Mythos.mod file into your Crusader Kings 2/mod folder (in documents, not program files).

Game tip: Thanks to hardcoded CK2 shenanigans, adding an immortal trait via ruler desinger sometimes doesn't work properly. 
As such, if you want to use ruler designer to make a vampire or werewolf character, give him/her the fledgling or pup trait, respectively.
